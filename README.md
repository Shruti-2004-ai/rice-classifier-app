It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

I wasn't able to generate and save the `README.md` file for you at this moment. But here's the full content — you can copy it into a new file manually:

### 📄 `README.md`

```markdown
# 🍚 Rice Classifier App

A machine learning-based web app for classifying rice grains into five different types using deep learning and image processing. Built with Streamlit and TensorFlow, the app predicts the rice type from an uploaded image and provides a confidence score.

---

## 🧠 Supported Rice Types

- Arborio
- Basmati
- Ipsala
- Jasmine
- Karacadag

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 Upload rice grain image (JPG, PNG, JPEG)
- 🔎 Predict rice type using a pre-trained `.h5` model
- 📊 View prediction confidence
- 🌟 Rate the prediction with user feedback
- 🖼 Use a sample image to test the app
- 🧱 Clean, mobile-friendly UI via Streamlit

## 🛠 How to Run the App Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shruti-2004-ai/rice-classifier-app.git
cd rice-classifier-app
````

### 2. (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run rice_app.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

## 📦 Build a Standalone `.exe` (Optional)

To build an offline Windows `.exe` that runs without Python:

1. Use `build_exe.bat` (included separately)
2. It packages the app using `pyinstaller`
3. Output: `dist/rice_app.exe`

✅ Works on any PC without needing Python installed.
